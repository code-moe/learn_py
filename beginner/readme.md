Three Programs I envisioned to create with Python :
1. Accounting software : just a simple one to use it myself, I can scan barcode and then it shows details like price, name, etc
2. Scheduler : well, I'm very forgetful so I want to create something to remind me of things when the time's right
3. My blog using Python : My own website I created myself.. I'm thinking trying Flask before Django..
